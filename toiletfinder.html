        <h2>Background :</h2>
        <p>Walking through the crowded streets of Manhattan NY, I was suddenly hit with the urge to use the bathroom. Some of you may know how dangerous this can be. Public bathrooms are a rare commodity in New York City, and many other cities across the United States. As a broke college student, being a "paying customer" was easier said than done. Many bathrooms lay behind a locked door that can only be accessed by those that receive the key from the worker behind the register. This is where I had the thought, a thought we've all had in our life at one time or another, "If only there was an app for this." An app to find a bathroom when you need it the most, ideally something that is clean and close. This is where Toilet Finder was&nbsp;born.</p>
      <div class="set-image-center3">
          <img class = "img-set4" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet1.jpg">
      </div>
        
        <h2>Design :</h2>
        <p>Design for the App started like most, it began with the quick sketches in my notebook to get everything down on paper as the ideas flooded in. Here are a few concept drawings I drew before I started&nbsp;building:</p>
      <div class="set-image-center3">
          <img class = "img-set4" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet2.jpg">
      </div>
        <p>Then I brought the sketched designs to the computer to be wire-framed&nbsp;out.</p>
      <div class="set-image-center3">
          <img class = "img-set3" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet3.png">
          <img class = "img-set3" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet4.png">
          <img class = "img-set3" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet5.png">
      </div>  
        <div class="set-image-center3">
          <img class = "img-set3" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet6.png">
          <img class = "img-set3" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet7.png">
        </div>
        
        <h2>Colors :</h2>
        <p>Next we needed a style, this was pretty intuitive since it was after all, an app that revolved around the bathroom. I decided to go with lots of different shades of blues with some orange-yellows for highlights and some fun simplistic font that was clean and easy to&nbsp;read.</p>
        <div class="set-image-center3">
          <img class = "img-set4" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet8.jpg">
        </div>
        
        <h2>Assets :</h2>
        <p>After this I decided to start making some of the icons and assets that would go along with the app. Again, being on the more novelty and quirky app style, I felt that many of the assets should be simplistic and fun. I decided to go with a man resembling someone that has to use the bathroom as main icon for the location of the user. I really liked this idea but also felt that this will require some later testing to make sure the users understood what it was and didnâ€™t affect&nbsp;usability.</p>
        <div class="set-image-center3">
          <img class = "img-set4" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet9.png">
        </div>
        
        <h2>Screen Flow :</h2>
        <p>Next we jumped into Sketch. This where I designed many of the workflows and GUI elements. I pulled ideas from my hand drawn sketches and developed on them with the assets I created as well as the styles I had previously decided&nbsp;on.</p>
        <div class="set-image-center3">
          <img class = "img-set4" src = "site_images/Toilet-Images/toilet10.png">
        </div>
        
        
        <h2>Final Design :</h2>
        <p>After settling on a user-flow and a comfortable GUI for the app, we brought everything into InVision to be prototyped. I experimented with many different animations for the app. I wanted it to feel lightweight but also have a clean polish with smooth fluid animations. Below is the final&nbsp;product!</p>

    <h2>Conclusion :</h2>   
    <p>I thoroughly enjoyed designing all the quirky elements that went into building this app. It was a lot of fun following the theme I set for myself and bringing an original idea to fruition. I plan to design and prototype more apps like this in the near future, so keep checking back if you liked this one!
