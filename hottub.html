      <h2>Style Guide</h2>
      
      <p>Our style guide documents all the unique visual elements that make up our HotTub brand. This is so everyone working on the development of HotTub can provide a consistent experience across the board. Since HotTub's brand is still evolving, this is set to grow and adapt in the&nbsp;future.</p>

      <h2>Logo Design</h2>
      
      <p>Me and our team were excited about the idea of HotTub. We wanted to create a logo to represent ourselves and our company. Before we developed a theme we wanted to experiment with the Rorschach test as a design element for our brand. After considering several design themes, we decided to go with a flowing water theme for our app that would distinguish our brand across all our&nbsp;platforms.</p>

      <h2>Homepage</h2>
    
      <p>After establishing what features we wanted our site to have and designed a wire frame to lay out where all these items would go, I began designing the HotTub homepage. Below you will see the evolution from the original design I made based on our wire frame through&nbsp;completion.</p>
      
      <p>Currently, all the text you see on the screens is a placeholder and is subject to change. You will notice there are some blank screens on some of the phones, this is purposely done since we are still deciding on user&nbsp;content.</p>

    <h2>HotTub's Pages</h2>
    
    <p>After some designing I decided to go with a flowing water theme for our app that can be distinguished across all our our platforms. After deciding on this theme it became very easy to wire frame out other portions of our site and implement features as&nbsp;necessary.</p>
    
    <p>Below you can see the different pages across our site. A similar evolution of each of HotTub's pages took place beginning with initial sketch to wire frame through the final design. Each page is continuously being tweaked as the development of HotTub takes&nbsp;place.</p>
    
    <div class="set-image-center">
      <img class = "img-set" src = "site_images/HotTub-Images/page1.png">
      <img class = "img-set" src = "site_images/HotTub-Images/page2.png">
      <img class = "img-set" src = "site_images/HotTub-Images/page3.png">
    </div>
    
    <p>It was very important in the design phase to ensure our site was responsive. We wanted to ensure our website will look great and work well on a desktop (or laptop), a tablet, and a mobile phone’s&nbsp;browser.</p>
    
    <p>Responsive web design creates a system for a single site to react to the size of a user’s device—with one URL and one content source. Our sites design offers a fluid and flexible layout which adjusts according to screen&nbsp;size.</p>
    
    <p>Below is an example of how our site's design would optimize itself based on the devices different aspect&nbsp;ratio.</p>

    <h2>User Flow</h2>
    
    <p>To push our MVP we decided on certain screens that were crucial to the deployment of our app. We will add onto this with more features and different capabilities for our application after initial development but for now this is our user guide I established for HotTub's&nbsp;MVP.</p>

    <p>Below is a breakdown of each of the screens specific design elements. This was done to be handed off to our team of developers, to make it easier for them to distinguish between what fonts, colors and sizes they should be using when developing the&nbsp;application.</p>
